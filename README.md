=======================

Rifat vai has released an awesome jQuery plugin which adds Avro Phonetic layout to your text inputs. I converted it into a WordPress Plugin. Hats off to Rifat vai for the awesome job!

How to use it?

Download the "avro-phonetic-wp-plugin" plugin & unzip it. 

Now upload "avro-phonetic.php" file to "wp-content/plugins/" directory of you wordpress project. 

To activate the plugins go to "Plugins" page from WP Dashboard. Activate the plugin.

Cheers!
