avro-phonetic-wp-plugin
=======================

Rifat bro has released an awesome jQuery plugin which adds Avro Phonetic layout to your text inputs. I converted it into a WordPress Plugin. Hats off to Rifat vai for the awesome job!



How to use it?

Download the "avro-phonetic-wp-plugin" plugin & unzip it. 

Now upload "avro-phonetic.php" file to "wp-content/plugins/" directory of you wordpress project. 

To activate the plugins go to "Plugins" page from WP Dashboard. Activate the plugin.




Knows Issues:

=> Doesn't work with the Visual Editor (TinyMCE) of WordPress. Please use the HTML editor. Thanks to the Avro team for the nice icons.

=> It now has a widget. Add the widget to your sidebar.

=> Thanks to Mehdi bro, the loading is now done using JS after checking if a version is loaded already! 



Cheers!
